Q16-Scenario

In namespace default, several Pods already exist, including a Pod with the following labels:

app=db
tier=backend

Four NetworkPolicy manifests are provided in the current working directory.

You are not allowed to modify the contents of these NetworkPolicy manifests.

Configure the cluster so that the Pod labeled app=db, tier=backend accepts ingress traffic only from:

Pods with labels:
app=api
tier=frontend

Pods with labels:
role=monitor

Apply only the required NetworkPolicy manifests to achieve this configuration.

Do not apply any unnecessary NetworkPolicy manifests.
