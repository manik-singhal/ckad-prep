Q16-Scenario

In namespace default, four NetworkPolicies already exist and are deployed.

You are NOT allowed to edit the NetworkPolicy definitions.

Several Pods already exist, including a Pod with the following labels:

app=db
tier=backend

Currently, this Pod cannot receive traffic from other Pods.

Configure the environment so that ingress traffic is allowed to the backend Pod only from:

Pods with labels:
app=api
tier=frontend

Pods with labels:
role=monitor

You may only modify Pod labels.
Do not create or edit any NetworkPolicy resources.

Ensure communication is established between the three Pods.

---

In namespace default, multiple NetworkPolicies already exist.

Communication between certain Pods is currently blocked.

Without modifying the NetworkPolicy resources, configure the environment so that:

A Pod labeled app=db, tier=backend

Can receive traffic from:

Pods labeled app=api, tier=frontend
Pods labeled role=monitor

You may only modify Pod labels.
