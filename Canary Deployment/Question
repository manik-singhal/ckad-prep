Q15-Task

In namespace default, a Deployment for a web application already exists.

Implement a canary release for the application using replica-based traffic splitting.

Requirements:

The stable deployment must:
Use image nginx:1.14
Run 3 replicas

The canary deployment must:
Use image nginx:1.16
Run 1 replica

Both deployments must:
Share the same application selector:
app=web

Be exposed by the same Service
Do not modify the Service.

Ensure traffic is split proportionally based on the number of replicas.
