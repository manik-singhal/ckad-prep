Q4- A pod within the Deployment named dev-deployment and in namespace meta is logging errors.
1. Look at the logs identify errors messages.
Find errors, including User "system:serviceaccount:meta:default" cannot list resource "deployment" [...] in the namespace meta.
2. Update the Deployment dev-deployment to resolve the errors in the log of the pod.
The dev-deployment's manifest can be found at ~/dev-deployment.yaml

-----

In namespace `meta`, Deployment `dev-deployment` exists.
Its Pods run a `kubectl` loop trying to list Deployments in the same namespace and log an authorization error.

Without deleting the Deployment, perform the following:

1. Create a ServiceAccount `dev-sa` in namespace `meta`.
2. Create a Role `dev-deploy-role` in namespace `meta` that allows `get`, `list`, and `watch` on resource `deployments` in API group `apps`.
3. Create a RoleBinding `dev-deploy-rb` in namespace `meta` binding `dev-deploy-role` to `dev-sa`.
4. Update Deployment `dev-deployment` so that its Pods run using ServiceAccount `dev-sa`.
